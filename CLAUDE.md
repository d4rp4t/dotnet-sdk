# NArk .NET SDK (Arkade)

## Branding
- The protocol/product brand is **Arkade** (not "Ark" on its own). Always use "Arkade" in user-facing text, docs, and comments.
- Code identifiers (namespaces, classes, variables) use `Ark` / `NArk` for brevity — this is fine and should not be renamed.

## Documentation

### Inline Doc Comments
- When adding or modifying any public API (class, method, property, enum), ALWAYS add or update the XML doc comment (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<remarks>` as appropriate).
- When changing behavior of an existing public API, update its doc comment to reflect the new behavior.
- Do not add doc comments to private/internal implementation details unless the logic is non-obvious.

### Generated Documentation
- This repo uses DocFX to generate API reference docs, deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
- When adding new public types or significantly changing existing ones, verify the docs build still succeeds: `dotnet tool restore && dotnet docfx docfx.json`.
- When adding a new feature area, add a conceptual article in `docs/articles/` and register it in `docs/articles/toc.yml`.
- Keep `docs/articles/` content in sync with actual SDK capabilities — if you add, remove, or rename a feature, update the corresponding article.

### README
- When adding any new feature, public API, or significant behavior change, ALWAYS add usage instructions to the README.md with code examples showing how to use the feature.
- README sections should include: what the feature does, how to set it up (DI registration), and a minimal code example.

## Project Structure
- `NArk.Abstractions` — Interfaces and base types (no implementation)
- `NArk.Core` — Protocol implementation (wallets, spending, contracts, transport)
- `NArk.Swaps` — Swap providers (Boltz, LendaSwap) and swap management
- `NArk.Storage.EfCore` — Entity Framework Core persistence
- `NArk.Tests` — Unit tests
- `NArk.Tests.End2End` — E2E integration tests (require nigiri + arkd)

## Testing
- Unit tests: `dotnet test NArk.Tests`
- E2E tests require external infrastructure (arkd, nigiri, boltz). Do not run locally without setup.
- NEVER skip or disable failing tests to make CI pass. Fix the root cause.

## Build
- Target framework: `net8.0` for libraries, `net10.0` for test projects
- CI: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (build + unit tests + E2E)
