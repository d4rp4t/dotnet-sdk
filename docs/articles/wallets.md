# Wallets

Wallets are stored in `IWalletStorage` and materialized as address/signing providers on demand by `IWalletProvider` (default: `DefaultWalletProvider`).

Two orthogonal axes describe any wallet — keep them separate at every layer:

**1. Key-derivation flavour** (`WalletType`):

| `WalletType` | Script shape | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SingleKey` | `tr(pubkey)` — one flat key | Static key, simple integrations |
| `HD` | `tr([fp/path]xpub/0/*)` — xpub-derived child set | Per-contract derivation, boarding support |

**2. Signing capability** — answered by `IWalletProvider.GetSignerAsync`, *not* by the data type:

| `ArkWalletInfo.Secret` | `IRemoteSignerTransport` claims it | `GetSignerAsync` returns | Capability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| non-empty | — | local signer (HD or SingleKey) | sign locally |
| null / empty | yes (`KnowsWalletAsync` → `true`) | `RemoteArkadeWalletSigner` proxy | sign via transport |
| null / empty | no | `null` | watch-only |

Capability lives at the *provider* boundary, not as a tag on the wallet record. Any combination of the two axes is valid: a remote-signed `SingleKey`, a watch-only `HD`, etc.

## HD Wallets (BIP-39)

Created from a BIP-39 mnemonic. The SDK derives per-contract keys along BIP-86 style derivation (`m/86'/coin'/0'`), giving:

- Unique address per invoice (privacy)
- Boarding address support (on-chain → Arkade)
- Deterministic recovery from the mnemonic

## SingleKey Wallets

Created from a Nostr `nsec` (raw 32-byte secret). All operations use a single static key:

- Simpler setup
- No boarding address support
- Suitable for testing or lightweight integrations

## Watch-Only and Remote-Signed Wallets

Both are described by the same data shape — `Secret = null` on an otherwise normal `ArkWalletInfo` — and distinguished at runtime by `IWalletProvider.GetSignerAsync`:

- No `IRemoteSignerTransport` registered, or `KnowsWalletAsync(walletId)` returns `false` → `GetSignerAsync` returns `null`. Watch-only: addresses and VTXOs are observable, signing-dependent operations (batch participation, unilateral exits) throw a descriptive `InvalidOperationException`.
- An `IRemoteSignerTransport` is registered and claims the wallet → `GetSignerAsync` returns a `RemoteArkadeWalletSigner` proxy. Every signing call is forwarded to the transport. The transport sees `walletId` on every call so one instance can serve many wallets (server-side signing service, HWI bridge, browser-extension wallet, …).

`WalletType` is independent: a watch-only HD wallet derives addresses from its xpub; a watch-only single-key wallet has one fixed address. Same for remote — derivation is whatever the descriptor encodes; the signer-source is whatever the transport claims.

## Creating a Wallet

`WalletFactory.CreateWallet` is a static helper that inspects the secret and produces the right `ArkWalletInfo` record. Persist the resulting record via `IWalletStorage`:

```csharp
var serverInfo = await clientTransport.GetServerInfoAsync(ct);

// HD wallet (from a mnemonic). Destination is an optional sweep-to Ark address.
var hd = await WalletFactory.CreateWallet(
    walletSecret: mnemonic,
    destination: null,
    serverInfo: serverInfo,
    cancellationToken: ct);
await walletStorage.SaveWallet(hd, ct);

// SingleKey wallet (from a Nostr nsec).
var sk = await WalletFactory.CreateWallet(
    walletSecret: "nsec1...",
    destination: null,
    serverInfo: serverInfo,
    cancellationToken: ct);
await walletStorage.SaveWallet(sk, ct);

// Watch-only OR remote-signed: same data shape — null Secret + the descriptor. Whether the
// wallet ends up watch-only or remote-signed is decided at GetSignerAsync time by whether an
// IRemoteSignerTransport is registered and claims this walletId (KnowsWalletAsync).
var nonLocal = await WalletFactory.CreateWatchOnlyWallet(
    accountDescriptor: "tr([abcd1234/86'/1'/0']tpub.../0/*)",
    destination: null,
    serverInfo: serverInfo,
    cancellationToken: ct);
await walletStorage.SaveWallet(nonLocal, ct);
```

`ArkWalletInfo.Id` is the deterministic wallet identifier derived from the descriptor — two imports of the same seed produce the same `Id`.

## Implementing a Remote Signer

For wallets whose `Secret` is null, the SDK never sees private material; every signing call is forwarded to an `IRemoteSignerTransport` you register in DI. The transport itself decides which wallets it can sign for via `KnowsWalletAsync` — wallets it doesn't claim fall through to watch-only.

Mirror `IArkadeWalletSigner` with an extra `walletId` parameter on each method, plus the `KnowsWalletAsync` probe:

```csharp
public class HardwareSignerTransport : IRemoteSignerTransport
{
    public Task<bool> KnowsWalletAsync(string walletId, CancellationToken ct)
        => _bridge.IsPairedAsync(walletId, ct);

    public Task<ECPubKey> GetPubKeyAsync(string walletId, OutputDescriptor descriptor, CancellationToken ct)
        => _bridge.GetPubKeyAsync(walletId, descriptor.ToString(), ct);

    public Task<MusigPartialSignature> SignMusigAsync(string walletId, OutputDescriptor descriptor,
        MusigContext context, MusigPrivNonce nonce, CancellationToken ct)
        => _bridge.SignMusigAsync(walletId, descriptor.ToString(), context, nonce, ct);

    public Task<(ECXOnlyPubKey, SecpSchnorrSignature)> SignAsync(string walletId, OutputDescriptor descriptor,
        uint256 hash, CancellationToken ct)
        => _bridge.SignAsync(walletId, descriptor.ToString(), hash, ct);

    public Task<MusigPrivNonce> GenerateNoncesAsync(string walletId, OutputDescriptor descriptor,
        MusigContext context, CancellationToken ct)
        => _bridge.GenerateNoncesAsync(walletId, descriptor.ToString(), context, ct);
}

services.AddSingleton<IRemoteSignerTransport, HardwareSignerTransport>();
```

`DefaultWalletProvider` accepts the transport as an optional constructor dependency — existing setups that don't use remote signing don't need to register one.

## Using a Wallet

`IWalletProvider` exposes wallets as address/signer providers:

```csharp
var provider = await walletProvider.GetAddressProviderAsync(walletId, ct)
    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Wallet not found");

// Provider gives you contracts / addresses; pair it with ContractService
// to derive and record the contract as a single operation.
```

## Contracts (Receiving Addresses)

Use `ContractService.DeriveContract` to produce a contract for a specific purpose, persist it, and return it:

```csharp
var contract = await contractService.DeriveContract(
    walletId,
    NextContractPurpose.Receive,
    ContractActivityState.AwaitingFundsBeforeDeactivate,
    metadata: new Dictionary<string, string> { ["Source"] = "invoice" },
    cancellationToken: ct);

var arkAddress = contract.GetArkAddress()
    .ToString(serverInfo.Network.ChainName == ChainName.Mainnet);  // tark1q... / ark1q...
```

`NextContractPurpose` values:

- `Receive` — new address for inbound VTXOs
- `Boarding` — on-chain address that can be boarded into Arkade (HD wallets only)
- `SendToSelf` — change / internal-use contract
